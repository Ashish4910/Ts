==> What is SQL ?
==> SQL is a Structure Query language 
==> SQL is standard Language for dealing with Relational Database which can be used to create , read ,update ,and Delete database records


===> What is database ?
1. Database is a systematic collection of data which support storage and manuipulation of data in easy way
2. Advantage of database 
                1.Managing large amoubnt of data
                2.Accuracy
                3.Ease of Data Upload
                4.Data security
                5.Data Integrity

==> What is DBMS ?
1. DBMS stand for Database management system 
2. DBMS is a system software responsible for creation , retrieval , update and management of database .
3. DBMS ensures that our data is consistent, organized, and is easily accessible by serving as an interface between the database and its 
   end-users or application software

===> What is RDBMS? How is it different from DBMS?
1.RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
2. The key difference here, compared to DBMS, is that RDBMS stores data in the form of a collection of tables, and relations can be defined between the common fields of these tables.
3. Most modern database management systems like MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, and Amazon Redshift are based on RDBMS.

==> What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?
1. SQL is a standard language for retrieving and manipulating structured databases.
2. On the contrary, MySQL is a relational database management system, like SQL Server, Oracle or IBM DB2, that is used to manage SQL databases.

==> What are Tables and Fields?
1.A table is an organized collection of data stored in the form of rows and columns.
2. Columns can be categorized as vertical and rows as horizontal.
3. The columns in a table are called fields while the rows can be referred to as records.

==>  What are Constraints in SQL?
1. SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
2. Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table.
3.This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table.
4.If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted.

Type of Constraints ==> 

1. NOT NULL - Restricts NULL value from being inserted into a column.
2. CHECK - Verifies that all values in a field satisfy a condition.
3. DEFAULT - Automatically assigns a default value if no value has been specified for the field.
4. UNIQUE - Ensures unique values to be inserted into the field.
5. INDEX - Indexes a field providing faster retrieval of records.
6. PRIMARY KEY - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
7. FOREIGN KEY - Ensures referential integrity for a record in another table.
